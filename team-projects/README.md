# Team Projects - Full Stack Development

## Overview

This folder contains **10 team project requirements** designed to evolve throughout the **13-week training program**. Each project starts as a **frontend UI application** and progressively transforms into a **full-stack cloud-deployed application** across three major project milestones.

Each project is designed for a **team of 4 members**, following Agile development workflows with Git collaboration, issue tracking, and code reviews.

### UI Storyboard/Wireframe Phase (Week 1-2)

The initial UI development serves as a **visual storyboard and wireframe** for the entire project:

- **Purpose:** Design and visualize all application screens before backend development
- **Deliverable:** Fully functional HTML/CSS/Bootstrap pages representing the complete user journey
- **Review:** End of Week 2 demo to validate UI design and user flow before proceeding

**What the UI Storyboard Demonstrates:**
- All pages and navigation flows
- Form layouts with field requirements (ready for backend validation)
- Data display formats (tables, cards, lists)
- User interactions and workflows
- Responsive design across devices

**UI Review Criteria:**
- [ ] All pages/screens completed
- [ ] Navigation between pages works
- [ ] Forms have proper fields and validation attributes
- [ ] Responsive on mobile, tablet, desktop
- [ ] Follows semantic HTML best practices
- [ ] Team demonstrates user journey walkthrough

## Git Workflow Requirements

### Repository Setup

1. **One team member** creates the repository and adds others as collaborators
2. Initialize with a `README.md` and `.gitignore`
3. Create a `main` branch (protected - no direct commits)
4. Create a `develop` branch for integration

### Branch Strategy

```
main (protected)
  └── develop (integration branch)
        ├── feature/home-page
        ├── feature/header-nav
        ├── feature/footer
        ├── feature/menu-page
        └── ... (one branch per feature)
```

### Branch Naming Convention

```
feature/<feature-name>     # New features
bugfix/<bug-description>   # Bug fixes
hotfix/<issue-number>      # Urgent fixes
```

### Workflow Steps

1. **Create Issue** - Before starting work, create a GitHub issue
2. **Create Branch** - Branch from `develop` using naming convention
3. **Commit Often** - Small, meaningful commits with clear messages
4. **Push & Create PR** - Push branch and create Pull Request to `develop`
5. **Code Review** - At least 1 team member must review and approve
6. **Merge** - Squash and merge after approval
7. **Close Issue** - Link PR to issue for automatic closure

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>: <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer - issue reference]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `style`: CSS/styling changes
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `docs`: Documentation

**Examples:**
```
feat: add responsive navigation menu

- Implement hamburger menu for mobile
- Add dropdown for sub-navigation
- Style active nav states

Closes #12
```
