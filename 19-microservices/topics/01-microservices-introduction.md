# Microservices Introduction

## Introduction to Microservices Architecture (MSA)

Microservices Architecture (MSA) is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, independent, and loosely coupled services. Each service is self-contained, implements a specific business capability, and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

### What Are Microservices?

Microservices are an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often HTTP-based APIs.

**Key Principles:**
- **Single Responsibility**: Each microservice focuses on one business capability
- **Independence**: Services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently
- **Decentralization**: Decentralized governance and data management
- **Resilience**: Designed to handle failures gracefully
- **Technology Diversity**: Different services can use different technologies

### Evolution from SOA

```
Traditional SOA → Microservices
- Heavy ESB        → Lightweight communication
- SOAP             → REST/gRPC
- Shared DB        → Database per service
- Monolithic ESB   → Decentralized
```

## Monolith vs Microservices

Understanding the differences between monolithic and microservices architectures is crucial for making informed architectural decisions.

### Monolithic Architecture

A monolithic application is built as a single, unified unit where all components are interconnected and interdependent.

**Structure:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│      Monolithic Application         │
│                                     │
│  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐       │
│  │   UI     │  │ Business │       │
│  │  Layer   │←→│  Logic   │       │
│  └──────────┘  └──────────┘       │
│       ↓              ↓             │
│  ┌─────────────────────────┐      │
│  │   Single Database       │      │
│  └─────────────────────────┘      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Advantages:**
- Simple to develop initially
- Easy to test end-to-end
- Simple deployment (single unit)
- Straightforward debugging
- No network latency between components

**Disadvantages:**
- Tight coupling between components
- Difficult to scale specific features
- Long-term maintenance complexity
- Technology stack lock-in
- Deployment of small changes requires redeploying entire application
- Reliability issues (one bug can crash entire system)

### Microservices Architecture

Application is decomposed into small, independent services organized around business capabilities.

**Structure:**
```
┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐
│ Service  │  │ Service  │  │ Service  │
│    A     │  │    B     │  │    C     │
├──────────┤  ├──────────┤  ├──────────┤
│   DB-A   │  │   DB-B   │  │   DB-C   │
└──────────┘  └──────────┘  └──────────┘
      ↕              ↕              ↕
    ┌────────────────────────────────┐
    │        API Gateway             │
    └────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Advantages:**
- Independent deployment
- Technology diversity
- Fault isolation
- Scalability (scale specific services)
- Team autonomy
- Easier to understand (smaller codebases)

**Disadvantages:**
- Increased complexity in distributed systems
- Network latency and reliability
- Data consistency challenges
- Testing complexity
- Deployment coordination
- Operational overhead

### Comparison Table

| Aspect | Monolith | Microservices |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Size** | Single large codebase | Multiple small codebases |
| **Deployment** | All-or-nothing | Independent per service |
| **Scaling** | Scale entire application | Scale individual services |
| **Technology** | Single tech stack | Multiple tech stacks possible |
| **Database** | Shared database | Database per service |
| **Development** | Single team or coordinated teams | Autonomous teams |
| **Testing** | Simpler integration testing | Complex distributed testing |
| **Failure Impact** | Can bring down entire system | Isolated to specific service |
| **Initial Complexity** | Lower | Higher |
| **Long-term Maintenance** | Harder as it grows | Easier with proper boundaries |

## Microservices Characteristics

### 1. Componentization via Services

Services are independently deployable components that communicate through well-defined APIs.

```java
// Each service is independently deployable
@SpringBootApplication
public class OrderServiceApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(OrderServiceApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

### 2. Organized Around Business Capabilities

Services are structured around business domains, not technical layers.

```
❌ Technical Layering:        ✅ Business Capabilities:
- UI Services                - Order Service
- Business Logic Services    - Payment Service
- Data Access Services       - Inventory Service
                            - Customer Service
```

### 3. Products not Projects

Teams own services end-to-end throughout their lifetime ("you build it, you run it").

### 4. Smart Endpoints and Dumb Pipes

- Services own their domain logic
- Communication channels are simple (REST, messaging)
- No complex ESB or orchestration layer

### 5. Decentralized Governance

Teams can choose technologies best suited for their service.

```
Order Service    → Java/Spring Boot
Payment Service  → Node.js/Express
Analytics Service → Python/Flask
```

### 6. Decentralized Data Management

Each service manages its own database (database per service pattern).

```java
// Order Service - owns its data
@Entity
public class Order {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private Long customerId; // Reference, not foreign key
    // ...
}
```

### 7. Infrastructure Automation

Heavy reliance on CI/CD, automated testing, and infrastructure as code.

### 8. Design for Failure

Services must be designed to handle failures gracefully.

```java
@CircuitBreaker(name = "paymentService", fallbackMethod = "paymentFallback")
public PaymentResponse processPayment(PaymentRequest request) {
    return paymentClient.process(request);
}

public PaymentResponse paymentFallback(PaymentRequest request, Exception ex) {
    return PaymentResponse.pending();
}
```

### 9. Evolutionary Design

Services can be replaced or upgraded independently.

## Benefits and Challenges

### Benefits

#### 1. **Independent Deployability**
```
Old Service V1 → Deploy V2 → Only Service X updates
Other services remain unchanged
```

#### 2. **Technology Flexibility**
```java
// Order Service - Spring Boot
@RestController
public class OrderController {
    // Java implementation
}
```

```javascript
// Notification Service - Node.js
app.post('/notifications', (req, res) => {
    // JavaScript implementation
});
```

#### 3. **Fault Isolation**
If Payment Service fails, Order Service can still accept orders (with degraded functionality).

#### 4. **Scalability**
```
High traffic on Catalog Service?
→ Scale only Catalog Service instances
→ Other services remain unchanged
```

#### 5. **Team Autonomy**
- Small, focused teams
- Independent decision-making
- Faster development cycles

#### 6. **Better Resource Utilization**
Scale services based on their specific needs, not entire application.

### Challenges

#### 1. **Distributed System Complexity**
- Network failures
- Latency issues
- Partial failures
- Service discovery

#### 2. **Data Consistency**
```
Problem: How to maintain consistency across services?
Solutions:
- Saga pattern
- Event sourcing
- CQRS
- Eventual consistency
```

#### 3. **Testing Complexity**
- Unit testing is simpler
- Integration testing is complex
- End-to-end testing requires all services

#### 4. **Operational Overhead**
- Multiple deployments
- Monitoring many services
- Log aggregation
- Distributed tracing

#### 5. **Network Latency**
```
Monolith: Method call (nanoseconds)
Microservices: HTTP call (milliseconds)
```

#### 6. **Versioning and Backward Compatibility**
Need to maintain API contracts while evolving services.

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

Domain-Driven Design is crucial for identifying and designing microservice boundaries.

### Core DDD Concepts

#### 1. **Domain**
The sphere of knowledge and activity around which the business logic revolves.

#### 2. **Bounded Context**
A boundary within which a particular domain model is defined and applicable.

```
E-Commerce System:

┌─────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────┐
│  Order Context  │  │ Payment Context │  │Shipping Context │
│                 │  │                 │  │                 │
│  Order          │  │  Payment        │  │  Shipment       │
│  OrderItem      │  │  Transaction    │  │  Address        │
│  Customer       │  │  Customer       │  │  Customer       │
└─────────────────┘  └─────────────────┘  └─────────────────┘
```

Note: "Customer" means different things in each context.

#### 3. **Ubiquitous Language**
A common language shared by developers and domain experts within a bounded context.

#### 4. **Entities**
Objects with unique identity that persists over time.

```java
@Entity
public class Order {
    @Id
    private Long orderId; // Unique identity
    private OrderStatus status;
    private List<OrderItem> items;
}
```

#### 5. **Value Objects**
Objects defined by their attributes, not identity.

```java
public class Money {
    private final BigDecimal amount;
    private final Currency currency;

    // No ID, equality based on values
}
```

#### 6. **Aggregates**
A cluster of domain objects treated as a single unit.

```java
// Order is the Aggregate Root
public class Order {
    private Long orderId;
    private List<OrderItem> items; // Part of aggregate

    // All access to OrderItems goes through Order
    public void addItem(OrderItem item) {
        this.items.add(item);
    }
}
```

#### 7. **Services**
Operations that don't naturally belong to any entity or value object.

```java
@Service
public class OrderPricingService {
    public Money calculateTotal(Order order) {
        // Pricing logic
    }
}
```

### Applying DDD to Microservices

**Step 1: Identify Bounded Contexts**
```
E-Commerce Domain:
- Sales Context
- Inventory Context
- Shipping Context
- Customer Context
- Payment Context
```

**Step 2: Map Contexts to Services**
```
Bounded Context → Microservice
Sales Context → Order Service
Payment Context → Payment Service
```

**Step 3: Define Context Boundaries**
```java
// Order Service owns Order aggregate
public class Order {
    private Long orderId;
    private Long customerId; // Reference to Customer Service
    private List<OrderItem> items;
}

// Customer Service owns Customer aggregate
public class Customer {
    private Long customerId;
    private String name;
    private List<Address> addresses;
}
```

## 12 Factor App Methodology

The 12 Factor App is a methodology for building software-as-a-service applications that are portable, scalable, and maintainable.

### I. Codebase
**One codebase tracked in version control, many deploys**

```
✅ One Git repository per microservice
✅ Same codebase → dev, staging, production

❌ Multiple repositories for same service
❌ Different code for different environments
```

### II. Dependencies
**Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies**

```xml
<!-- Maven: Explicit dependencies -->
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
        <version>3.2.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### III. Config
**Store config in the environment**

```yaml
# application.yml - NO hardcoded values
spring:
  datasource:
    url: ${DATABASE_URL}
    username: ${DATABASE_USER}
    password: ${DATABASE_PASSWORD}
```

```bash
# Environment variables
export DATABASE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/orderdb
export DATABASE_USER=admin
export DATABASE_PASSWORD=secret123
```

### IV. Backing Services
**Treat backing services as attached resources**

```yaml
# Can swap databases by changing config
spring:
  datasource:
    url: ${DATABASE_URL} # Local, staging, or production DB
```

### V. Build, Release, Run
**Strictly separate build and run stages**

```
Build:  code → executable bundle (JAR/WAR)
Release: bundle + config → release
Run:    execute release in environment

# CI/CD Pipeline
Build → Create artifact → Deploy to env → Run
```

### VI. Processes
**Execute the app as one or more stateless processes**

```java
// ❌ Storing state in memory
public class OrderController {
    private List<Order> orders = new ArrayList<>(); // BAD!
}

// ✅ Stateless - use external storage
@RestController
public class OrderController {
    @Autowired
    private OrderRepository orderRepository; // GOOD!
}
```

### VII. Port Binding
**Export services via port binding**

```yaml
# application.yml
server:
  port: ${PORT:8080} # Configurable port
```

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class OrderServiceApplication {
    // Self-contained, exports HTTP service on port
}
```

### VIII. Concurrency
**Scale out via the process model**

```
Scale horizontally by running multiple instances:

Instance 1 (Port 8081) ─┐
Instance 2 (Port 8082) ─┤→ Load Balancer → Clients
Instance 3 (Port 8083) ─┘
```

### IX. Disposability
**Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown**

```java
@Configuration
public class GracefulShutdownConfig {
    @Bean
    public GracefulShutdownTomcat gracefulShutdownTomcat() {
        return new GracefulShutdownTomcat();
    }
}
```

```yaml
# Fast startup
spring:
  jmx:
    enabled: false # Disable if not needed
```

### X. Dev/Prod Parity
**Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible**

```
Development   → PostgreSQL
Staging       → PostgreSQL (same version)
Production    → PostgreSQL (same version)

❌ SQLite (dev) → MySQL (staging) → PostgreSQL (prod)
```

### XI. Logs
**Treat logs as event streams**

```java
// Don't manage log files
logger.info("Order created: {}", orderId);

// Let environment handle log routing:
// - Development: Console
// - Production: Log aggregation service
```

### XII. Admin Processes
**Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes**

```bash
# Database migration as separate process
java -jar flyway.jar migrate

# Data cleanup job
java -jar app.jar --spring.profiles.active=admin cleanup
```

### Applying 12 Factor to Spring Boot Microservices

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class OrderServiceApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(OrderServiceApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

```yaml
# application.yml - Configuration
spring:
  application:
    name: order-service # Factor I: Codebase
  datasource:
    url: ${DATABASE_URL} # Factor III: Config, IV: Backing Services
  profiles:
    active: ${SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE:default} # Factor X: Dev/Prod Parity

server:
  port: ${PORT:8080} # Factor VII: Port Binding

management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: health,info # Factor XI: Logs, XII: Admin
```
