## Agile Manifesto

### Four Values
1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

### Twelve Principles
1. Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery
2. Welcome changing requirements
3. Deliver working software frequently
4. Business and developers work together daily
5. Build projects around motivated individuals
6. Face-to-face conversation is best
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
8. Sustainable development pace
9. Technical excellence and good design
10. Simplicity is essential
11. Self-organizing teams
12. Regular reflection and adjustment

## Scrum Events in Detail

### Sprint Planning (2-4 hours for 2-week sprint)
- What can be delivered in the sprint?
- How will the work be achieved?
- Select items from Product Backlog
- Create Sprint Goal
- Break down into tasks

### Daily Standup (15 minutes)
Three questions:
1. What did I do yesterday?
2. What will I do today?
3. Are there any blockers?

### Sprint Review (1-2 hours for 2-week sprint)
- Demo completed work
- Gather feedback
- Update Product Backlog
- Discuss what's next

### Sprint Retrospective (1-1.5 hours for 2-week sprint)
- What went well?
- What didn't go well?
- What can we improve?
- Action items for next sprint

## Writing User Stories

### Format
```
As a [type of user],
I want [an action],
So that [a benefit/value].
```

### Examples

**Good User Story:**
```
As a customer,
I want to filter products by price range,
So that I can find items within my budget.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Min and max price inputs are available
- Filter applies when "Apply" button is clicked
- Results update dynamically
- Price range is displayed in the UI
```

**Another Example:**
```
As a registered user,
I want to reset my password,
So that I can regain access to my account if I forget it.

Acceptance Criteria:
- "Forgot Password" link available on login page
- User receives email with reset link
- Link expires after 24 hours
- New password meets security requirements
```

## Estimation Techniques

### Planning Poker Process
1. Product Owner presents user story
2. Team discusses and asks questions
3. Each member selects a card (Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
4. All reveal cards simultaneously
5. Discuss differences, especially outliers
6. Re-estimate until consensus

### Story Point Scale
- **1 point**: Trivial change, <1 hour
- **2 points**: Simple task, few hours
- **3 points**: Moderate complexity, half day
- **5 points**: Average story, 1 day
- **8 points**: Complex, 2-3 days
- **13 points**: Very complex, needs splitting
- **21+ points**: Too large, must split

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Writing User Stories
Write user stories for the following scenarios:
1. A user wants to add items to a shopping cart
2. An admin needs to generate sales reports
3. A customer wants to track their order status

Include acceptance criteria for each story.

### Exercise 2: Story Point Estimation
Given the following features, estimate story points:
1. Add a logout button to the navigation bar
2. Implement user registration with email verification
3. Create a dashboard with 5 different charts
4. Fix a typo in the about page
5. Integrate third-party payment gateway

### Exercise 3: Create a Sprint Board
1. Draw or create a digital Kanban board with columns:
   - To Do
   - In Progress
   - Code Review
   - Testing
   - Done
2. Add 8-10 user stories/tasks to the board
3. Distribute them across columns as if in mid-sprint

### Exercise 4: Sprint Retrospective
Reflect on a recent project (can be from any course or work):
1. List 3 things that went well
2. List 3 things that didn't go well
3. Propose 3 action items for improvement

### Exercise 5: Product Backlog Prioritization
Given a list of 10 features, prioritize them based on:
- Business value
- User impact
- Technical complexity
- Dependencies

Use MoSCoW method: Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have

## Best Practices

### For Development Teams
- Keep daily standups focused and brief
- Be transparent about blockers
- Collaborate and help team members
- Focus on delivering value
- Embrace continuous improvement

### For Product Owners
- Keep backlog groomed and prioritized
- Be available for team questions
- Accept or reject work based on Definition of Done
- Represent stakeholder interests
- Provide clear acceptance criteria

### For Scrum Masters
- Facilitate ceremonies effectively
- Remove impediments
- Shield team from distractions
- Coach team on Agile practices
- Foster self-organization

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Using daily standup for status reporting to management
- Skipping retrospectives
- Changing sprint scope mid-sprint
- Not defining clear acceptance criteria
- Carrying over incomplete work sprint after sprint
- Having sprints longer than 4 weeks
- Micromanaging the development team
