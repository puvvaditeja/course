# REST Fundamentals

## Overview

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It provides a standardized approach to building web services that are scalable, maintainable, and easy to understand.

## Introduction to REST

### What is REST?

REST is an architectural style introduced by Roy Fielding in his 2000 doctoral dissertation. It defines a set of constraints and principles for creating web services that communicate over HTTP.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Stateless**: Each request from client to server must contain all information needed to understand and process the request
- **Client-Server Architecture**: Separation of concerns between user interface and data storage
- **Cacheable**: Responses must define themselves as cacheable or non-cacheable
- **Uniform Interface**: Standardized way of communicating between client and server
- **Layered System**: Client cannot tell if it's connected directly to the end server or an intermediary

### RESTful Web Services

A RESTful web service is a web service implemented using HTTP and the principles of REST. It:

- Exposes resources through URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers)
- Uses HTTP methods to perform operations on resources
- Returns data in standard formats (JSON, XML)
- Is stateless and scalable

**Example RESTful Resource:**
```
GET /api/users/123
```

This URI represents a specific user resource with ID 123.

## REST Principles

### 1. Client-Server Separation

The client and server are independent components that communicate over a network. This separation allows:

- **Independent Evolution**: Client and server can be developed and scaled independently
- **Improved Portability**: Client can work across different platforms
- **Scalability**: Servers can be replicated and load-balanced

### 2. Statelessness

The server does not store any client context between requests. Each request is self-contained.

**Benefits:**
- **Scalability**: No session state on the server means easier horizontal scaling
- **Reliability**: No risk of session data loss
- **Simplicity**: Each request can be handled independently

**Example:**
```http
# Bad - Stateful (relies on server remembering previous request)
GET /api/products/next

# Good - Stateless (all information in request)
GET /api/products?page=2&size=20
```

### 3. Cacheability

Responses must explicitly indicate whether they can be cached to improve performance.

**HTTP Cache Headers:**
```http
Cache-Control: max-age=3600
ETag: "33a64df551425fcc55e4d42a148795d9f25f89d4"
Last-Modified: Wed, 21 Oct 2023 07:28:00 GMT
```

### 4. Uniform Interface

REST uses a standardized interface based on HTTP methods and resource URIs.

**Core Constraints:**
- **Resource Identification**: Resources are identified by URIs
- **Resource Manipulation through Representations**: Clients manipulate resources through representations (JSON, XML)
- **Self-Descriptive Messages**: Each message includes enough information to describe how to process it
- **HATEOAS**: Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (clients navigate through hyperlinks)

### 5. Layered System

The architecture can be composed of hierarchical layers, with each layer providing services to the layer above it.

**Benefits:**
- Load balancers can be added
- Caching layers can improve performance
- Security layers can be inserted

### 6. Code on Demand (Optional)

Servers can extend client functionality by transferring executable code (e.g., JavaScript).

## HTTP Methods

HTTP methods define the action to be performed on a resource. RESTful services use these methods to implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

### GET - Retrieve Resources

Retrieves a representation of a resource without modifying it.

**Characteristics:**
- **Safe**: Does not modify the resource
- **Idempotent**: Multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request
- **Cacheable**: Responses can be cached

**Examples:**
```http
# Get all users
GET /api/users

# Get a specific user
GET /api/users/123

# Get users with filtering
GET /api/users?role=admin&status=active

# Get nested resources
GET /api/users/123/orders
```

**Response Example:**
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "role": "admin"
}
```

### POST - Create Resources

Creates a new resource on the server.

**Characteristics:**
- **Not Safe**: Creates new resources
- **Not Idempotent**: Multiple identical requests create multiple resources
- **Not Cacheable**: Typically not cached

**Example:**
```http
POST /api/users
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Jane Smith",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "role": "user"
}
```

**Response:**
```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: /api/users/124
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": 124,
  "name": "Jane Smith",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "role": "user",
  "createdAt": "2023-12-12T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### PUT - Update/Replace Resources

Replaces an existing resource entirely with the provided representation.

**Characteristics:**
- **Not Safe**: Modifies resources
- **Idempotent**: Multiple identical requests have the same effect
- **Not Cacheable**: Typically not cached

**Example:**
```http
PUT /api/users/123
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "John Doe Updated",
  "email": "john.updated@example.com",
  "role": "admin"
}
```

**Response:**
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "John Doe Updated",
  "email": "john.updated@example.com",
  "role": "admin",
  "updatedAt": "2023-12-12T10:35:00Z"
}
```

### PATCH - Partial Update

Updates only specific fields of a resource without replacing the entire resource.

**Characteristics:**
- **Not Safe**: Modifies resources
- **Not Necessarily Idempotent**: Depends on implementation
- **Not Cacheable**: Typically not cached

**Example:**
```http
PATCH /api/users/123
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "john.newemail@example.com"
}
```

**Response:**
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.newemail@example.com",
  "role": "admin"
}
```

### DELETE - Remove Resources

Removes a resource from the server.

**Characteristics:**
- **Not Safe**: Removes resources
- **Idempotent**: Deleting multiple times has the same effect
- **Not Cacheable**: Typically not cached

**Example:**
```http
DELETE /api/users/123
```

**Response:**
```http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

Or with a response body:
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "message": "User deleted successfully",
  "id": 123
}
```

### Method Comparison Table

| Method | CRUD | Safe | Idempotent | Request Body | Response Body |
|--------|------|------|------------|--------------|---------------|
| GET | Read | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| POST | Create | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| PUT | Update/Replace | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| PATCH | Partial Update | No | No* | Yes | Yes |
| DELETE | Delete | No | Yes | No | Optional |

*PATCH can be designed to be idempotent, but it's not guaranteed

## HTTP Status Codes

Status codes indicate the result of an HTTP request. They are grouped into five categories.

### 1xx: Informational

Rarely used in REST APIs. Indicates the request was received and processing continues.

| Code | Meaning | Usage |
|------|---------|-------|
| 100 | Continue | Client should continue with request |
| 101 | Switching Protocols | Server switching to different protocol |

### 2xx: Success

The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.

| Code | Meaning | Usage |
|------|---------|-------|
| **200** | OK | Standard successful response (GET, PUT, PATCH) |
| **201** | Created | Resource successfully created (POST) |
| **202** | Accepted | Request accepted for processing (async operations) |
| **204** | No Content | Success but no response body (DELETE) |

**Examples:**

```http
# 200 OK - Successful GET
GET /api/users/123
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
{ "id": 123, "name": "John" }

# 201 Created - Successful POST
POST /api/users
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: /api/users/124
{ "id": 124, "name": "Jane" }

# 204 No Content - Successful DELETE
DELETE /api/users/123
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

### 3xx: Redirection

Further action needs to be taken to complete the request.

| Code | Meaning | Usage |
|------|---------|-------|
| 301 | Moved Permanently | Resource permanently moved to new URI |
| 302 | Found | Temporary redirect |
| 304 | Not Modified | Resource hasn't changed (caching) |

**Example:**
```http
GET /api/users/123
If-None-Match: "33a64df551425fcc55e4d42a148795d9f25f89d4"

HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
```

### 4xx: Client Error

The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.

| Code | Meaning | Usage |
|------|---------|-------|
| **400** | Bad Request | Invalid request syntax or parameters |
| **401** | Unauthorized | Authentication required or failed |
| **403** | Forbidden | Authenticated but not authorized |
| **404** | Not Found | Resource doesn't exist |
| **405** | Method Not Allowed | HTTP method not supported for resource |
| **409** | Conflict | Request conflicts with current state (duplicate resource) |
| **422** | Unprocessable Entity | Validation failed |
| **429** | Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded |

**Examples:**

```http
# 400 Bad Request
POST /api/users
{ "email": "invalid-email" }

HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "Invalid email format",
  "field": "email"
}

# 401 Unauthorized
GET /api/users/123

HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "Missing or invalid authentication token"
}

# 403 Forbidden
DELETE /api/users/123

HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
{
  "error": "Forbidden",
  "message": "You don't have permission to delete users"
}

# 404 Not Found
GET /api/users/999

HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
{
  "error": "Not Found",
  "message": "User with id 999 not found"
}

# 409 Conflict
POST /api/users
{ "email": "existing@example.com" }

HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict
{
  "error": "Conflict",
  "message": "User with this email already exists"
}

# 422 Unprocessable Entity
POST /api/users
{ "name": "", "email": "valid@example.com" }

HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity
{
  "error": "Validation Failed",
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": "name",
      "message": "Name cannot be empty"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5xx: Server Error

The server failed to fulfill a valid request.

| Code | Meaning | Usage |
|------|---------|-------|
| **500** | Internal Server Error | Generic server error |
| **501** | Not Implemented | Server doesn't support the functionality |
| **502** | Bad Gateway | Invalid response from upstream server |
| **503** | Service Unavailable | Server temporarily unavailable |
| **504** | Gateway Timeout | Upstream server timeout |

**Examples:**

```http
# 500 Internal Server Error
GET /api/users/123

HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
{
  "error": "Internal Server Error",
  "message": "An unexpected error occurred"
}

# 503 Service Unavailable
GET /api/users

HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
Retry-After: 3600
{
  "error": "Service Unavailable",
  "message": "Service is temporarily down for maintenance"
}
```

### Status Code Selection Guide

**For Successful Operations:**
- Use `200 OK` for successful GET, PUT, or PATCH
- Use `201 Created` for successful POST with resource creation
- Use `204 No Content` for successful DELETE or operations with no response body

**For Client Errors:**
- Use `400 Bad Request` for invalid request format
- Use `401 Unauthorized` for missing/invalid authentication
- Use `403 Forbidden` for insufficient permissions
- Use `404 Not Found` for missing resources
- Use `409 Conflict` for duplicate or conflicting resources
- Use `422 Unprocessable Entity` for validation errors

**For Server Errors:**
- Use `500 Internal Server Error` for unexpected server failures
- Use `503 Service Unavailable` for temporary unavailability

## RESTful URI Design Best Practices

### 1. Use Nouns, Not Verbs

URIs should represent resources (nouns), not actions (verbs). The HTTP method indicates the action.

**Good:**
```
GET /api/users
POST /api/users
GET /api/users/123
PUT /api/users/123
DELETE /api/users/123
```

**Bad:**
```
GET /api/getAllUsers
POST /api/createUser
GET /api/getUserById/123
PUT /api/updateUser/123
DELETE /api/deleteUser/123
```

### 2. Use Plural Nouns for Collections

```
GET /api/users          # Collection
GET /api/users/123      # Specific resource
GET /api/products       # Collection
GET /api/products/456   # Specific resource
```

### 3. Use Hierarchical Relationships

Represent relationships through URI hierarchy.

```
GET /api/users/123/orders           # All orders for user 123
GET /api/users/123/orders/789       # Specific order for user 123
GET /api/categories/5/products      # All products in category 5
```

### 4. Use Query Parameters for Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination

```
# Filtering
GET /api/users?role=admin
GET /api/products?category=electronics&inStock=true

# Sorting
GET /api/users?sort=name
GET /api/products?sort=-price  # Descending order

# Pagination
GET /api/users?page=2&size=20
GET /api/products?offset=40&limit=20

# Searching
GET /api/users?search=john
GET /api/products?q=laptop
```

### 5. Version Your API

```
# URI Versioning
GET /api/v1/users
GET /api/v2/users

# Header Versioning
GET /api/users
Accept: application/vnd.myapi.v1+json
```

### 6. Use Kebab-Case or Snake_Case Consistently

Choose one convention and stick with it.

```
# Kebab-case (recommended for URIs)
GET /api/user-profiles
GET /api/order-history

# Snake_case (common in JSON)
{
  "user_id": 123,
  "first_name": "John"
}
```

### 7. Keep URIs Lowercase

```
# Good
GET /api/users/123

# Bad
GET /api/Users/123
GET /api/USERS/123
```
